**I am a second-year PhD candidate in the Department of Linguistics at Yale University**.
My research focuses on the syntax and semantics of **West African languages**, with a particular interest in the morphosyntax of bare nominals and their (in)definite interpretations. Currently, I work primarily on Yorùbá and Igbo.



**2025**

**Ongoing**
- Definiteness and the Yorùbá Bare Noun
- The Semantics of *kan* in Yorùbá: *Indefinite* or *Specificity*? 
  
**What's New?**
- Backward Association of Exclusive Particles and Scope Freezing (*with* Ka Fai Yip & Daniel Aremu)
- Are Splitting Verbs in Yorùbá Discontinuous Heads? (*with* Ka Fai Yip)

**2024**
- On the Syntax of Yorùbá Splitting Verb Constructions (Accepted for publication)
- A Quantifier-Particle Approach to Exclusive Focus Particles in Yorùbá *with* [Ka Fai Yip](https://kafai-yip.github.io/)
