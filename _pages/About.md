I am a second-year PhD student in Linguistics at Yale University, where I explore the intricate connections between language structure and meaning. My academic journey began with a Bachelor’s degree in Linguistics & Yoruba Language, followed by a Master’s degree in Yoruba Language from the University of Lagos, Nigeria. These foundational experiences deepened my passion for the morphosyntax and semantics of West African languages, particularly Yoruba, Igbo, and Ogugbe.My research is driven by a fascination with formal semantics and the interplay between natural languages and mathematical expressions. I am currently working under the guidance of Professor Veneeta Dayal on my first Qualifying Paper, which investigates **Bare Nouns and Definiteness in Yoruba**. This project reflects my broader interest in how languages encode meaning and how these systems can be formally modeled.Through my work, I aim to contribute to the understanding of understudied languages and bridge gaps between linguistic theory and the rich diversity of human languages.
