I joined the Yorùbá Unit of the Department of Linguistics, African and Asian Studies at the University of Lagos, Nigeria, as a Graduate Assistant in 2018. In October 2020, I was appointed Assistant Lecturer in the same department. Before moving to Yale University to pursue my PhD, I also worked as a lecturer at the Institute of African and Diaspora Studies (University of Lagos), where I taught Yorùbá as a Second Language under the Yorùbá Language and Cultural Proficiency Program (YLCPP). Additionally, I occasionally taught Introductory Yorùbá Phonetics and Phonology at the School of Foundation Studies. My experience has continuously fueled my interest in teaching Yorùbá as a second language. I have particularly dedicated more time to dissecting the difficulties encountered by L2 learners of Yorùbá in areas such as numerals, pronouns, honorific pronouns, and important cultural aspects like food and traditional clothing.
I am a member of the Yorùbá Studies Association of Nigeria (YSAN) and the Linguistic Association of Nigeria (LAN).    


**CULTURAL WORKS**
- Between 2021-2022, I worked on a project that was funded by the Institute of African and Diaspora Studies (UNILAG). During this project, we focused on Yorùbá traditional means of transportation, especially those used by hunters and warriors. A paper from this project has been published. You can find it here
